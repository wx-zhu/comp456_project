# Adverse Childhood Experience in US: A Data Science Approach

## Overview
This project delves into exploring the connections among Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), family factors, and their influence on children's mental health, developmental delays, and physical wellness. By conducting thorough data analysis and visual representation, the primary goal is to unveil correlations that shed light on their direct impact on children's overall well-being in the US.

## Reproducing the Work
To replicate our analysis, follow these steps:
- Clone the Repository: Use git clone to clone the repository.

- Data: Download the datasets listed in the Data folder's README from https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.html.

- Environment Setup: Set up your environment using R studio and ensure you have the necessary packages installed.

## Data Dependencies
The project's data sources are drawn from [NSCH Datasets](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.html) with a special focus on Topical Data from 2018 to 2021. Due to size constraints, the original datasets are not included in the repository but we upload the cleaned csv data for 2021 in the data file as well as the corresponding official code book.
